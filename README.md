#### Now Featuring: [Pong, ...in SPACE!](http://playingwithmyself.github.io/games/pong.html) 
Seeking a new life, and new civilizations pong is boldy going where so many cliches, already have, Space!

### Huh?
Exactly what is sounds like, pretty much whackin' it. Anything in here is scrounged up as the throw away remnants of god knows what other project to which they were in some way relevant at one time. A code recycle bin/testing ground Sounds F***'n Awesome right! If for whatever reason it gets action I'll make the effort to put something worthwhile in it. 

I can be reached for comment care of "mr Blue" as in, me holding my breath ;) 

### Here's the Deal / How To Play 
Click On A Game if you have issues there is a sometimes a [Statspring!](http://statspring.com/) or [Statspring  Github](http://statspring.github.io) url that will look similar, next to it. if the first doesn't work try StatSpring its a static launching service thats coming up fast and you can use it to serve all raw sites you come across whether they are on github.io/gh-pages yet or not. you will find through using it, such a tool can be immensely useful and powerful for development and just quick code inspects no account setups nothing.
